	<h5 style="color:red;">Factory Key</h5> | This should never leave your gamma and opens two additional extracts and allows you to open the locked room in third floor offices. Possible <span style="color:darkorchid;">weapon spawn</span> in locked room, two coats, loose loot and occasional high end ammo. This key spawns in the office of 3-Story in Customs, and the glass warehouse in Customs (in the blue locker or near the dead scav).

	<p class="paragraph">
	<h5>Key (pumping station)</h5> | Opens the "closed bunker" near machinery in the exit area but only the door nearest extract. There is rarely anything worth picking up in here but it can be a good ambush position. This key spawns in the locker room on the bench against the wall close to the entrance.
